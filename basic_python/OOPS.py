# programming paradigms (styles of programming)
# 1. structured programming 
# 2. procedural programming 
# 3. object-oriented programming 
# 4. functional programming 



# benifits of oops 
# 1. binding 
# 2. object - an object has 
#           ----> attributes ----> create attributes variables
#           ----> behavior ---> create behavior methods // functions 
# 3. class - is a blueprint/ templates 
# creating a class from syntax -

# the difference between methods and functions is that 
# methods are binded to the class (can be used via object) 
# whereas function can be used indepedently

# ---> all methods are by default functions. 
# ---> all functions are not methods until defined inside a class 
# ---> self is keyword which is used to bind a particular object with its class
# ---> object is an actual implementation of the class
# ---> instance is the virtual copy of the object
